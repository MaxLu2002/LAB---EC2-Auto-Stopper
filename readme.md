# Terraform Project Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps to configure and deploy Terraform scripts for managing your AWS environment.

*Note: The commands provided are tailored for PowerShell.*

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- Terraform
- AWS CLI

## Steps

1. **Navigate to the Production Directory**
    ```bash
    cd ./prod/
    ```

2. **Set AWS Configuration**
   - Configure your AWS CLI with the appropriate credentials.
   - Update the `provider.tf` file with the correct AWS account details.

3. **Prepare Terraform Files**
    - **`provider.tf`**: Specify the AWS provider configuration.
    - **`main.tf`**: Define the resources and modules to be deployed.
    - **`terraform.tfvars`**: Provide variable values required by your Terraform scripts. Example:
    ```hcl
    region              = "ap-northeast-2"
    tags                = { Name = "test" }
    bucket_count        = 2
    vpc_count           = 2
    vpc_cidr            = ["10.0.0.0/16", "10.1.0.0/16"]
    public_subnet_count = 2
    private_subnet_count = 2
    availability_zones  = ["ap-northeast-2a", "ap-northeast-2b"]
    ```

4. **Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration**
    ```bash
    terraform init
    terraform validate
    terraform plan
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

5. **Optional: Destroy Terraform Resources**
    ```bash
    terraform destroy -auto-approve
    ```

## Notes
- Review and customize the Terraform files (`provider.tf`, `main.tf`, `terraform.tfvars`) to match your specific requirements before applying the configuration.
- Always run `terraform validate` and `terraform plan` to verify your changes before applying them to avoid unexpected outcomes.

By following these instructions, you can efficiently set up and manage your AWS infrastructure using Terraform.

### Observations:
- The original content had minor formatting issues, such as inconsistent emphasis and unclear descriptions for some steps. These have been clarified.
- The example for `terraform.tfvars` was valid and has been retained with minor formatting adjustments for better readability.
- The step about setting AWS configuration was rephrased for clarity.
